## Overview

**AI430** is a microservice gateway project.  
It serves as a centralized gateway to route, proxy, and orchestrate requests to underlying services.  

## Features

- Request routing and proxying  
- Authentication / authorization (if applicable)  
- Load balancing / failover (if applicable)  
- Aggregation of responses from multiple microservices  
- Logging, metrics, tracing  
- Graceful error handling  

*(Customize this list to reflect what your implementation actually supports.)*

## Architecture & Components

Describe your architecture: e.g.:

- **Gateway** — the main entry point, handles incoming HTTP(s) requests  
- **Service A, B, C** — downstream microservices  
- Configuration / discovery / registry  
- Middleware: auth, logging, rate limiting  
- Docker / containerization (if used)  

You may include a diagram (e.g. ASCII, or embed an image) showing the flow of requests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [ ] A recent version of **Python** (or whatever language/runtime your project uses)  
- [ ] Docker & Docker Compose (if your setup uses it)  
- [ ] Other dependencies (e.g. kong, database, message queue)  

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishnurajvv/AI430.git
   cd AI430
